# Digit_recognition
Digit recognition is a prominent topic in computer vision. Initially, we planned to create a program that recognizes different fruits by looking at pictures. However, we encountered difficulties in selecting distinguishing features for each fruit. As a result, to differentiate ourselves from others, we decided to pursue a new approach of our own. Rather than creating a program that recognizes numbers in images, we opted to create a program where we personally write the numbers in real-time and then have the system recognize and interpret those handwritten digits.
